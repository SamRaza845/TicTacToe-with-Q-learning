# TicTacToe-with-Q-learning
Code and description file of an AI agent that uses reinforcement learning (Q-learning algorithm) to learn by playing with humans after initial automated training.
I built this project as part of my artificial intelligence unit at Murdoch University, where I was doing my Masters in Information Technology; I developed an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe player using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The project focused on implementing Q-learning, a model-free RL algorithm that enables an AI agent to learn optimal strategies through trial and error. Unlike traditional rule-based approaches, which follow predefined strategies, our AI adapted its gameplay based on experience, improving over time without explicit programming.

Q-learning works by maintaining a Q-table, where each state-action pair is assigned a value representing the expected reward. The AI plays multiple games, selecting actions based on an exploration-exploitation tradeoffâ€”sometimes choosing the best-known move and sometimes exploring new options. After each move, the Q-values are updated using the Bellman equation, which considers immediate rewards and future expected rewards. Over time, the AI refines its strategy to maximize long-term success. This project enhanced my understanding of reinforcement learning, dynamic decision-making, and AI adaptability in real-world applications.
